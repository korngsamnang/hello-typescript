## Installation
Before you start. There are few things you need to install:
1. A text editor. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), A JavaScript runtime.
3. TypeScript. Run `npm install -g typescript` in your terminal.
This will allow you to compile TypeScript files to JavaScript files.
4. TS-Node. Run `npm install -g ts-node` in your terminal.
This will allow you to run TypeScript files directly from your terminal.
5. Install a Code Runner extension in VS Code. This will allow you to run code directly from VS Code. (Optional)
6. Make a shortcut key for code runner. (Optional)
